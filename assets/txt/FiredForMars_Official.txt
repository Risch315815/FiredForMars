@ Chapter 1: The Fight for Serenity

Outside apartment 3E‑7, there were nothing but the screech of surveillance camera rotating.

Brendan stood outside the door, shoulders square, holding a burlap bag wrapped with red velvet tape.

He rehearsed three versions of this negotiation. He didn’t like any of them, but he can't stand another night of the noise next door flooding through his paper-thin wall, crushing his serenity. 
"How can a chief of an entire department be so... so clueless?" 
However, he's still the chief of a department. Better safe than sorry.

He exhaled and knocked, twice—brisk, professional.
It took thirty seconds for the door to open.
Changan appeared: shirt half-buttoned, collar wilted, the corner of his mouth drooling. His eyes found the gift first. Then Brendan’s face.
Brendan frowned at the sight of his shabbiness.

“Director Hertz,” Changan said. 
“Director Wang,” Brendan replied, leaning in, a social smile fixed to his face. “Thank you so much for agreeing to meet me at such a late hour.”
Without a pause, Brendan took Changan’s hand and pressed the package into it.
“A pleasant supplement,” he said, each word chiseled, “for a good night’s sleep.”

Changan’s body moved before he thought.
“Where are my manners. Please, come in. I’m terribly sorry for the mess.”
He placed the gift at the center of the living room table, fingers barely brushing the velvet.

“It is such noble work you’re doing,” Brendan said, still smiling. “But please, do be careful. You never know who’s on the other side of the wall. It would be a shame if anything fell into the wrong ears.”
“Director Hertz,” Changan replied gently, “there’s no one on the other side of the wall.”

Brendan blinked. Is this man daft?
“I suppose I just don’t have the mental capacity to process everything I heard.” Brendan said, with a forced smile. “Who knows what I might do.”

Changan’s eyes widened, but he reined himself in.
“I’m really sorry, sir. It’s just… I’ve been wearing headphones for twelve hours today, and you know how uncomfortable government-issued headphones can be. Please...”
“Oh! How diligent of you!” Brendan beamed. “Perhaps I can take a look at your AI auditor. Help make it more efficient?”

Changan’s mouth twitched. He straightened.
“I believe everyone has the right to approach his life the way he fancies,” Brendan continued. “I just hope he knows others have important work to do. Work that requires ample rest. Isn’t that right, Chan-gan?”

The name landed like a slap.

Changan’s smile faded. His hands shook.
“Please leave,” he said.
“Excuse me?”
“I said, please leave.” He roared.

Brendan stepped out immediately.
The door hissed shut.

---

Changan dropped into his chair, staring at the velvet-wrapped package still sitting on the table like a forgotten message.

The shame wasn’t in being loud. It was in being an inconvenience. In being noticed.
He was breathing rapidly now. He had to disappear again, before someone noticed what he really was.
With trembling hands, he opened the burlap bag—not out of curiosity, but as a distraction; hoping it would be trash, so he could throw away the last ten minutes and pretend they’d never happened.

Inside was a vacuum-sealed packet of Earth-grown tea. His favorite thing when he was growing up in a small mountain village in Fujian.

He cried uncontrollably. It was the first time in twenty years.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@ Chapter 2: The Wrong Ears

By morning, Changan’s ears were in agony.
The screen strain gave him blurring migraines. The earphones pressed too deep, slicing at already-sensitive cartilage.
By 7 a.m., his right ear canal was bleeding.

Still, no sound leaked from his room.

--

Office hour was over.

Changan stared at the box for a long time before even touching it. A box left right in front of your door without being confiscated by the building guard could mean a lot, but not much.
He finally accepted his fate, since it's only a matter of time.
It was a well-made headphone. Noise-canceling. Proper padding.
No one ever gave him anything without a reason.
He didn’t care. He put them on immediately. No scraping, no ache. Only the dull hum of filtered sound. He nearly cried again.

--

That night, just before 01:00, heavy boots thundered down the corridor.
Metal rang. Commands barked. A voice he recognized—Brendan’s—raised, then abruptly cut off.
Changan didn’t move. He didn’t look through the peephole. He didn’t even flinch.
Instead, he turned up the volume: it covered the shouting. The dragging. The silence that followed.
He kept working long past the point of clarity, until his vision blurred and the cursor blinked without input. He didn't remember falling asleep—only waking up hours later with a stiff neck.
The headphones were still on.

--

The next day, lunch was replaced with a summons.
He was escorted to a windowless conference room. Harsh light. A long table.
Brendan sat on the other side. He looked like he hadn’t slept at all.
An officer read out the charges—unauthorized equipment transmission, signal misattribution, breach of device origin protocol. The built-in flagging system picked up sensitive content from Brendan’s headphone, while he was asleep. It kept playing after he was arrested.
Changan stayed silent.

Last night, after waiting for hours in the interrogation room for the police officers to handle paperwork, the investigator finally entered the room. Brendan immediately confessed that he gave his own headphone to Changan Wang, Director of Media and Emotion Wellbeing, who he had absolutely nothing to do with.
Then he received hours of further interrogation because it was caught on surveillance camera that he entered Changan Wang's room the night before, with a "suspicious object" in his hand. 
After that, Brendan stayed silent as well.

"We don’t punish kindness,” the officer said, smiling with no warmth, “only negligence.”
They were dismissed with minor penalties: written censure. Docked rations. Weeks of increased monitoring.


They walked out together. Said nothing. Didn’t look at each other.
It was a long walk back to their neighboring cells. I mean room.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ Chapter 3: The Leash

It was 23:28 on Earth.

The exhaust fan wheezed like it was dying. The room stank of synthetic tar and shared silence.

A junior programmer sat on a cardboard box, hunched over, vape pen glowing between his fingers. His badge ID was still on.
“I don’t get it,” he muttered. “We push overtime, sleep at our desks, eat nutrient packs like lab rats. For what? My buddy freelances and clears twice my pay.”
He took another hit. Coughed.
“I’ve been thinking about just… leaving. Starting something small.”

On the other side of the room, the senior programmer didn’t look up. He was older, greying at the edges, sleeves rolled up in that way that didn’t look rebellious, just permanent.
“You ever heard of SynThread?” he asked.
The junior blinked. “No?”
The older man gave a small laugh. “Exactly.”

He flicked ash into the tray. The silence between them stretched, filled only by the hum of electricity through too-thin walls.
“They launched maybe five years ago. AI-powered automatic review of government tenders, budget auditing, system maintenance, and propaganda generation. They had real velocity. The kind of team that coded through blackouts.”
“What happened?”

The man leaned back. Exhaled smoke toward the ceiling fan.
“One of their employees posted a meme mocking the government. Got flagged as behavioral nonalignment.”
The junior snorted. “Seriously?”
“Seriously. Four days later, their compute quota vanished, couldn’t render a homepage without buffering.”
“Damn.”
“Emptied their capital to purchase state issued computation bonds, 0% return. Resorted to loan sharks since they were flagged; still got bankrupt shortly after. No one had any idea where their core algorithm went.”

The fan kept whirring. Both men stared ahead.

“Guess I’m lucky I’m at a state-owned corp, huh?” the junior said, trying for a smile.
The older man nodded slowly. “Yeah. Lucky.”
The junior stood, dropped his vape cartridge into the bin.
“You heading back in?”
“Sure.”

Their badge read:
Leona State Government | Construction and Maintenance Section

The door shut behind him. The fan never stopped spinning.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@ Chapter 4: Power, and How to Lose It

The meeting room was small, but there were three cameras. On the projection screen were the colony metrics for the week.
Blue for acceptable. Red for failure. Yellow for… review.

Officer Naidu, Head of the Board of Security and Stability, was putting on his earpiece. The rest of the board members were listening from the other side. Or so they claim.

“Electric usage has exceeded safe tolerance for the fourth consecutive night,” Naidu said. “Citizen satisfaction remains within acceptable parameters.”

Changan let out a breath.
Acceptable. Good. He was safe.
“I am more than honored to serve the government with all that I can do,” he said meekly.

Naidu didn’t look up.

Brendan snared. “I once heard a man burn down a house because there was a mouse in it. Would you applaud that man, Director Wang?”

Changan smiled.
 “Wouldn’t it be worse to let the mouse run around the house?”

Brendan’s eyes narrowed. He turned to face the officer.
“I suggest that we limit broadcasted content to reruns of approved programming, not exceeding 1080p in fidelity.”

Changan leaned forward, hands flat on the table.
“The content we provide includes morale-boosting interactive programs and low-delay generative emotion-stabilizing protocols. They’re not luxury. They’re containment. The most efficient shepherd to keep the masses from going astray.”
His voice rose, confidence solidifying.
“Let me remind you: the Media & Emotional Wellbeing Department has been serving this government for over 180 years; preserving clarity, alignment, and preventing public dissonance through repeated, validated engagement structures. Static 2D visuals are like shoving nutrients down the throat. Through interactive programming, we condition compliance through repeated actions and affirmations.”
He smiled victoriously. "The colony needs us."

Brendan waited three seconds, just long enough for silence to settle.
“What marvelous work you are doing,” he said dryly. “I absolutely admire it. Now, shall we discuss the technical aspects of your operation?”

Changan blinked.
“Sure.”

Brendan turned his tablet slightly toward the board.
“Your generative loops have been requesting the same audiovisual assets every single time they’re triggered. Nothing is cached. The average packet is 160MB. They are triggered 11.6 times per minute per user.”

Silence.
“We… we have been under-resourced,” Changan said stiffly. “Not everyone on my team is a trained developer.”

Brendan waited again. Three seconds.
“I would like to propose an optimization framework. Is that acceptable to the Director of Media & Emotional Wellbeing?”
Changan nodded, though his posture had tightened.
“We’d like to give citizens with high rebellion index access to more engaging, higher-demand content; citizens with low rebellion index would be restricted to static content.”
“You want to reward instability?” Changan asked.
“We should give them some incentives to swim against the stream.” Brendan said smoothly. “That way we'll just have to wait for them at the top of the waterfall.”
He smiled like an angel.

“Based on correlation models between rebellion score and content demand, your overall energy draw will decrease by 17.3%. I sincerely ask the board to grant a one-month trial for implementation.”

Naidu raised a hand.
“Please give the board a moment to discuss.”
He pressed a finger to his earpiece. Thirty seconds passed.
“Approved. You’ll be co-reporting weekly progress. Dismissed.”

---

The room emptied with a shuffle of chairs and bureaucratic stillness.

Changan was still processing what happened as he stumbled toward the exit. Brendan walked past him, crisp and calm.
“What a pleasant meeting, Director Wang,” Brendan said over his shoulder. “I promise the Power Allocation Office will be sending its finest to aid in our cause.”

He smiled.

Changan could not do the same.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ Chapter 5: Welcome Committee

The Media and emotional wellbeing department’s pale fluorescent panels flickered slightly overhead, casting a sterile, bluish light on wrappers of junk food scattered all over the desk.

Changan arrived precisely on time. As he scanned his badge, his eyes flicked across the room. Something was off.

Officer Hertz was there.

Sleeves rolled, expression easy, Brendan was reviewing a screen with a sharp but amused look.
“That’s a clean loop,” he said, gesturing to a line of code. “Mind if I borrow this structure for the content scheduler back home?”
The junior beamed. “Of course, Officer Hertz.”
There were two mugs of tea on the desk. Someone had offered him the second. Brendan didn’t even glance at Changan as he entered.
He hadn’t taken Changan’s desk, but he may as well have.


Brendan had been in the department for a few days.
He came bearing energy drinks and snack. Small morale boosters, symbolic kindness.
Then came the shared code sessions. Brendan led them with a teacher’s flair:
“Let’s try reducing the fetch frequency on these API calls, just for fun.”
The room hummed. Screens flickered with test cases and optimization outputs. Enthusiasm swelled.
No one wanted to scrub flagged posts anymore.

The content vetting queue ballooned.
Flagged posts piled up with sarcastic anti-colony slogans, coded expressions of dissent, cryptic images loaded with buried meanings. Normally this work was evenly distributed. Now it fell on Changan. And on Min, the only staffer too burnt-out to resist.

Changan reminded the others gently; firmly, they nodded, promised, forgot.
So he stayed late.
His eyes burned as red metrics blinked across the moderation dashboard.

Staff began looping their queries through Brendan first.
Brendan never encouraged it. He just answered quicker. Smiled more. Made their ideas sound smarter.
Junior Staffer: “Director Wang wanted us to finish our flagging quota...”
Brendan: “That can wait. You’re onto something smarter here.”

No one argued. No one asked Changan.


He found Brendan alone at the water station late that week.
“You’re not helping,” Changan said. “You’re distracting them from the work we’re actually supposed to do.”
Brendan took a sip. “And yet they’re building something. Not bad for a department of frat bros.”
Changan’s jaw tightened. “They’re overexcited amateurs. You know that.”
Brendan shrugged. “Yeah, I do.” 
Then he walked off.


The room emptied. Again.
Changan sat alone. The review queue blinked, pages long.
At the top, a message:
Backlog exceeds review capacity. Consider escalation.
He didn’t escalate.
He put on his headphones.
And started again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ Chapter 6: Uplift, Overheat

Chad was used to his post being censored, but last week his post stayed longer than usual.
 
"The government s numbing us with all the content they feed us!"
It didn’t disappear. No warning. No lockout.
Weird.

He tried again.
"The government should open free brothels, not just phone us in with AI that can barely flirt!"
Still there when he woke up.
He grasped the chance to post more provokative contents, and got extensive views.

---

A few days later, something even better happened: his content feeds were faster, crisper. He could even have that "law-abiding consensual intercourse" simulation he always wanted with the AI.
After busting a load, he proudly shared his "invention" with the forum, claiming that "the mind-numbing AI can now generate hot pillow talk; all you have to do is ask".
The post exploded. "Finally", "How?", "Why can't I do it?", thousands of replies flooded in within minutes.
"I guess it's the reward for a truth-teller." Chad replied with pride, pictured the envious face of all the less fortunate incels, and decided to bust another load.
However, his account was banned. Whatever, he had dozens of them. But now he had to pee.

After he returned from the toilet, he heard police banging on the doors across the street.
"Guess it's unethical to frame your neighbor." He said to himself. "Well, never likes that guy anyways."

He tries to start the same intercourse simulation with his backup account, but only got "I'm sorry, but explicit content is against the policy."
He was furious. "How dare you refuse me! You think I'm like those beta male out there? I'll bend you to my knees!"
He furiously posted the way he manipulated the AI into the intercourse simulation, the prompt, the setting, the things to avoid. The post garnered thousands of replies as well. He got access to the explicit content again.

Better yet, this time his account is not banned.

He quickly posted his magnum opus: "The secret to unlock the good stuff: provocative content. The more views you get, the hotter the sex is. 24 hours, once-in-a-lifetime chance."
The whole internet exploded. It was like two ant colony fighting each others to death: crashing, screaming for attention; rivals tearing each other apart with long-hoard dirt while audience thundered with blood in their eyes.

It was bloodbath, and Chad was enjoying every bit of it.

---

Without notice, the page froze. He refreshed it. No response.
The lights were cut off. Darkness fell like the sky crumbled.
Outside, someone yelled "They're draining oxygen!" Chad heard scream and shout all over the place. Doors opened, doors slammed shut. He couldn't even move a bit.

Suddenly, he heard his window smashed, forcing him to hide under his bed. Several masked figures burst in, one grabbed his ration stash, another two ripped his screen and computer tower from his desk. He heard smashing and stumping, then the footsteps left the unit.

He hid under his bed long after the screaming died down outside.

------------------------

The next morning, Brendan and Changan stood before officer Naidu, Head of the Board of Security and Stability. Deputy Director of the Power Allocation Office, Youssef Ahsan, was seated on the side, but he insisted on standing. There were armed guards at each exit.

Brendan and Changan were not cuffed, but there were no where to run. Youssef locked his eyes on the seat in front of him.


“The Board notes and commends Deputy Director Youssef Ahsan for immediate corrective action. Grid stabilization initiated under his command limited the blackout to 86 minutes." Naidu read. "The board designate you as the new Director of the Power Allocation Office."
"I thank the board for his decision." Said Youssef, without raising his head. "Do I have the permission to leave?"
"You do."
Youssef left the room without looking at Brendan once. 

---

Naidu turned to Changan.

“Changan Wang, Director of the Media and Emotion Wellbeing. You failed to escalate review anomalies visible within thirty-six hours of the initial surge. Your department’s moderation backlog exceeded threshold by 212%.”

“May I have a statement?"
Naidu nodded. 
"At the beginning of the development of the new system, I encouraged Officer Hertz, and failed to properly assign personnel (distribute workforce), which lead to the exceeded backlog." Changan’s voice was even.
"Right before the launch, we were overworked and exhausted, so I circumvented the standard procedure by only giving Officer Hertz verbal permission, and asking him to launch under in his name."
Brendan looked at Changan, incredulous. His mouth opened, then shut. 
"That would be my statement."

Naidu pressed against his earpiece. After 60 seconds, he stated the verdict.
“Your department’s computational quota will be reduced by 10% for the next quarter. Your salary will be cut by 20% for 6 months. Reassignment pending.”

---

Naidu turned to Brendan.

“Brendan Hertz, former Director of the Power Allocation Office. You authorized deployment of an content-tiering system without adequate internal testing, without approval from the assigned director of the department that is responsible.”
Naidu paused.
“This resulted in a 423% spike in emotional traffic, a 17% rise in flagged instability, and a critical overload in District C-9’s grid.”
Naidu stared at Brendan.
“You are hereby removed from your post and reassigned to a subordinate position in the Media and Emotion wellbeing. Effective immediately.”

---

"Finally, you have been relocated to room 6B. You will be sharing accommodations until further notice. Case closed."

--------------------------------

Room 6B had a double-bunk bed, like a prison cell. Changan sat at the shared desk, reviewing flagged posts.
“Why did you help me?” Brendan asked.
Changan didn’t turn. “Because that week, they were smiling. They worked like they believed in something.”
“I’d forgotten what that felt like. So... thank you, Officer Hertz.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ Chapter 7: The Long Thread

It took Brendan two days to learn every task the Media & Emotional Wellbeing Department had to offer.

He didn’t feel trapped—not like he expected.
This is the first place he can ignore the red tape and actually play for once. He felt like a kid again, sprinting along the Kansas River, chasing the curve of the horizon.
He felt alive.

He turned his attention to legacy code that hadn’t been properly maintained since the first terraforming decade.
He knew this language like a long-lost friend: used it to bring back a salvaged machine older than the Kansas river. That project won him his college scholarship, and taught him how stubborn yet elegant this language could be.
His fingers tapped through a stack of syntax lines with a calm, methodical rhythm, adjusting functions, redrawing flowcharts on his pad. 
Ancient, but powerful.

Across the room, Changan watched, but said nothing.

---

Brendan showed the prototype to the others. Someone shouted out, "Witchcraft! This is witchcraft!".
“This is not witchcraft, silly.” Brendan laughed. “It's just conditions and loops, like what you were writing a few weeks ago.”
They were hesitant at first. Then curious. Then obsessed.

They graded posts manually, then came audio, then video. They calibrated for sarcasm, for cultural drift, for tone.
Changan signed the data request without comment.

Compute access was tight. Brendan didn’t complain. He adjusted.
When the training cycle hit its limit, the team volunteered to shift to manual flagging for half the queue, just to buy the model breathing room.

Brendan brought snacks, instant coffee, shoulder rubs. They built something together.

---
Changan was visible scared of the upper bunk, so Brendan took it as if of preference. 

At night, the dorm was always cold.
Changan sat hunched over the shared desk. The room glowed faint green, data from the day still dancing on-screen. Brendan had fallen asleep in the chair first that night.
Changan stood, hesitated, then pulled the blanket from the bunk.
He laid it over Brendan’s shoulders.
Brendan stirred. Didn’t speak. Just smiled.

Another night, Changan passed out mid-review; Brendan tried to lift him gently to bed.
Changan jolted awake.
Brendan murmurs, “Sorry. Didn’t want you to cramp your neck again.”

---

Brendan walked into the office with 2 huge bags of snack and instant coffee in his hands. "I'm so terribly sorry that things are like this, guys."
Most of his team were exhausted. Sam "the battery bunny" was the only one who squeezed out a grin. "It's fine, sensei. We learned a lot and had fun."

Changan waved at him from within the office. Brendan stepped into the office.
“I accidentally entered the admin logging shell last night,” Changan said. “Got a warning email from the Board thirty seconds later.”
Brendan nodded. “Reasonable.”
“It happened to you too, back when you were checking the source code of the flagging system.”, said Changan. "They were exceptionally harsh. It took me a ton of apologies and promises to get us out of trouble."
“They’re probably waiting for one of us to trip up again.”
Changan smiled, tired. “Promise me: keep it in the sandbox. Don’t let anything leak out.”

Brendan grinned. "Sure. Might as well live once before we die."

---

They started betting on who would fall asleep first. They began telling stories: 
Brendan talked about the alligators in the swamps of Kansas, and how people thought they were only found in Florida.
Changan lamented how tea grown on hills were the only nice thing in his childhood; everything else were so cheap and gray.
Neither ever mentioned anyone they loved, and neither asked.

Three more months. Benchmarking. Error smoothing. 
Brendan stayed to fix the back-end report parser.
Changan stayed late to write the executive brief. 
They filed a request to launch the new flagging model.

---

Youssef couldn't stop adjusting his necktie.
"How dare him come back!" he thought to himself. "It's only been 9 months! How on Mars does he expect anyone to trust him? Besides, what is the board of Security and Stability thinking? They should have cut off his tail, not letting him raise it like a cat in heat!"
He tightened his tie; the suffocation somehow calmed his nerves. "For years, I thank god for making him my chief. Not a day passed where I didn’t wonder how he ended up in a hellhole like this."
He loosened his tie. "Guess time always tells." 


"Director Ahsan." Brendan greeted Youssef before entering the conference room, gently placing a palm on his back.
"There are a thousand more ways to redeem yourself. Don't do this, chief. Please." Youssef begged.
"You owe me nothing. In fact, I thank you for fixing the blackout so quickly." Brendan smiled, looking straight into Youssef's eyes. "I'm so happy to see you grow, even in a barren place like this."

Grow. 
Youssef hadn’t heard that word in years. Not here. Everything here is built to restrain and control. 
The word hit him like spring rain on Earth: weightless, yet so revitalizing. His eyes were wet.
"I didn't make it. A bunch of enthusiastic young kids did." Brendan had the warmest smile on his face. "Do it for them. Do it for the future of Mars."


The presentation went stunningly. The new model may took more computational force than the old one, but it shows significant gains in speed, ambiguity reduction, and reliability under strain.
Still, Youssef spotted several incidents where they should use local instead of global variables. 
"Amateurs", he mumbled, with a smile of approval.


The board approved further evaluation.
Youssef requested a month to review the full script; if passed, it would go through a three-stage trial: small, medium, full-scale. Each monitored in real time by a third party.

The board agreed, but insisted the third party only handle statistics.
All raw content grading would fall to the Media & Emotional Wellbeing Department.

It would take everything they had.

---

One night, Brendan was too tired that he slipped climbing up to the upper bunk. A dull thump, Changan found Brendan whimpering on the ground, holding his right ankle. 
He took him to first aid. The nurse was asleep. She offered ibuprofen.

The next morning, Brendan got a cast. Before the cast came off, Changan pinned him to the lower bunk, while he himself took the desk.

Two weeks in, Brendan can't take it anymore. "Let's just share the bed. You walk like someone's been pounding your behind for pleasure."

Changan stiffened.

"It... it's against cohabitation protocol."

Brendan shrugged.

"You’ll snore. I don’t sleep through snoring."

"I won’t."

"I overheat easily."

"I don’t."

"What if someone reports it?"

Brendan didn’t reply.

"I just don’t think it’s... appropriate."

Brendan rolled over, facing against him, closed his eyes. "Okay."

----

Changan's stalling worked. 

Youssef approved the new model, which means that they will have to grade the post, audio and image content red flagged by the old flagging system manually, in real time, for 2 weeks. It was slightly more exhausting than it used to be, but they are up to it.

2 weeks later, their manual grading workload expanded from the red-flagged content to the yellow-flagged ones. 
Changan’s eyes, ears, back were constantly burning. They slept in broken shifts. Two hours at best. Never when they wanted.

Then the full-scale trial started. They have to walk through each frame of each video content. It's like hundreds of thousands of hours of content. 

Changan heard Brendan crying in the bathroom again. He know things have to change. 
Thank god that the board of Security and Stability agreed to shorten the period of monitor to 7 consecutive days (they still use the 24 hour per day, 7 days per week cycle).

4 months later, the Media & Emotional Wellbeing team finished the manual grading. The new model was launched, and Changan could finally get 6 hours of sleep.
 
-----

Changan still refuse to share the bed with Brendan.

He woke up at 3 am again. His back and neck is aching, and he can't feel his arms.
He tried to get up and stretch, but fell to the ground immediately. His pelvis has been pressed for too long that barely pulling it sent a searing pain through his ventral side. As he laid on his side on the rock-hard ground twitching, he saw the warm and soft bed, with a scent of jasmine.
He climbed onto it, fell asleep surrounded by things warm and soft.

It was the best sleep he had in years, and he wasn't late because Brendan woke him up right after his REM phase ended.

That night, he climbed in that bed. Back-to-back, they didn’t speak. 
Then shoulder-to-shoulder.
Then in whatever position, like it was meant to be.

---

"I can't believe I'm getting accustomed to sleeping more than 6 hours each night. I'm not sure I'm supposed to." Said Changan.
Brendan smirked. "Perhaps I should wake you in the middle of the night to keep you vigilant."
"Please don't." Changan grabbed Brendan's hand under their sheet. "Just... try to not leave me."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Chapter 8: Back Where I’m From

Changan grabbed Brendan's hand under their sheet.
"Just... try to not leave me."

Brendan let out a dry chuckle.
"Silly. Where am I supposed to go? The upper bunk?"
Changan paused and backed up a little bit, trying to see the whole picture.
"You don’t sound like you’re joking," Changan said. "You sound... stuck."
Brendan rolled his eyes.
"Duh. Aren’t we all?"

Changan hesitated, then tried again.
"Yeah, but yours feels different. Like it goes deeper, more ancient. Not culturally, personally."
Brendan smiled, bitterly. He turned to face Changan, tapped the tip of his nose.
"It’s cute when you try. Like a puppy trying to climb onto a sofa."
Then he rolled onto his back.
"I guess it’s time. For you to meet my parents."

Changan held back a perfect roast and stayed neutral.
"Go on~"

Brendan’s eyes drifted toward the ceiling.
"My parents had well-paid jobs, then AI replaced them. We ended up living on welfare."
He paused.
"They hated, no, abhor technology in general after that. Our farm became a bunker with no devices or terminals, nothing."
His voice dropped.
"I thought we were just poor, but when I tried to show my dad the old robot I spent six months trying to fix, he smashed it. With a shovel. In my face. Then walked away."

Changan couldn't hold in the roast any longer. "Meet your parents? What? Are you trying to marry~ me~?"

He expected Brendan to laugh, at least sarcastically, then tease him back, but Brendan didn’t laugh.
He looked into Changan's eyes, with the rage of being disrespected. "You know what?" But then there was the disgust for Changan's lack of sensitivity. "Never mind." Finally just exhaustion. "Forget it."

Changan stiffened. Changan knew he had misread the moment, but he felt entitled to Brendan's tolerance for the inconvenience Brendan caused him, so he didn't apologize.
Instead, he pivoted.
"I wasn't smart as you, so I had to compete with tens of millions of people for a few thousand slots in the college entrance exam. I thought I missed a whole section in math, so I blamed myself for squandering my one and only chance to leave that broken mountain town. I pictured myself doing nothing but plowing the fields and selling empty plastic bottles for 2 whole months before the test result came out." He was bitter at first, but turned into bragging without noticing it. "Turned out I didn't miss the section, and I got into the top university. As I was supposed to."

Brendan felt heat rise in his chest.
"Hey. This is not a competition," He said. "But when I was in college, even the slightest hint of the inherent disadvantage of a female body because they have to offer a huge chunk of their energy to develop their womb, which they are probably never going to use, will get you cancelled indefinitely. That was what happened to my roommate, and he died in a gas station robbery when he was working the late night shift there."

Changan was radicalized. "How are there still gas stations? Where was he, Oklahoma?" He was incredulous. "Also, you think the chauvinist bashing was bad? Where I came from, if a man was seen kissing another man, both of them would be thrown into a bag and drown in a river."
Brendan was triggered. He turned on his back, started gasping for air; his eyes searched aimlessly, trying to hold onto a thought that can calm him down. Changan continued without noticing Brendan's panic attack: "After that, they would be hanged on the tree on the outskirt of the village, and their closest relatives would hang a board on them that condemns them for bringing disgrace to their family. Spoilers: it's usually by their parents."

Brendan, still trembling, could only utter: "I'm sorry to hear that." 


Changan was caught in the heat of the moment, and didn't expect Brendan to back down. 
"Y... Yeah." 
Then he quickly realized how he was using a cruel gay-bashing tradition as a weapon, and felt immensely ashamed about himself. "Oh my god. I am so so sorry." 
Then he noticed the horror on Brendan's face. "Are you okay?"

Brendan sighed. "I don't know. I don't think I'll ever get what I truly want. Maybe people like us will never, ever, get what we truly want."
Changan stayed quiet. Brendan’s pinky brushed the back of his hand, tentative.
"I know it’s selfish. I have more than most. But it still hurts."

There was a long silence between the two of them.

Changan broke the silence. "It doesn't have to be that way." He held Brendan's hand under their sheet again. "If you want us to meet your parents, we can."
Brendan smiled as if seeing the endless Kensas field again. "Yeah. We should go to Kensas. We can just walk along the Kensas river and talk for hours on end. We can have a small farm where we can grow our own food, raise our own cow and chicken, just the two of us. Just like my mom and dad."
Brendan felt the warmth in Changan's hand. "They would see how gentle and patient you are, and they would... want you to stay."
Changan turned towards Brendan, holding his face, thumb brushing through his stubble. "Is it okay for men to kiss in Mississippi?"
Brendan smiled. "Kensas, dummy." 

Then he kissed him.

@ Chapter 9: Back to the Start

Act 1:

[ It was a calm and serene morning. Brendan opened his eyes, and see Changan sleeping by his side. He propped his head up with one arm, smiling at Changan, brushing his fingers through his hair, and started to sing ]

<morning>
(verse)
Brendan:
Its you who know my heart
It's not a wholesome one from the start
the beating from your touch, oh my love [ Changan opened his eyes, he looked at Brendan with a smile ]
more than it ever was

Changan:
Breathing like I was not
Breath in the sweet the sour no bitter
Bathing within the light the river
There's nowhere else to find

(pre chorus)
Brendan + Changan: [ both sit up from the bed, holding one hand ]
I don't know what is old
I don't know what is new

Changan: With every moment froze in time [ Changan stepped out of bed ]
Brendan: With every word I sing to you [ Brendan followed him ]

(chorus)
Changan: Now that I know where i can start

Brendan + Changan:
To place my heart

Brendan: I never have to wait in the dark
Changan: I know that you know

I should have known way from the start 
where I belong

Brendan: Nothing will ever do us apart...
(the announcement sounds abruptly)
"Officer Brendan Hertz/Changan Wang. You have been assigned to a new unit. You have been granted a paid day-off to relocate to your new accommodation."

---

Act II

[ Lights up on Room 6B, the shared dorm now caught in limbo
Brendan and Changan are gathering the item that belong to each of them, placing them at their respective corner: Brendan's is on the working desk next to the console, Changan's is on a cozy 3 layered shelf.
They moved around the room in perfect harmony, like they always do.
But this time, slightly avoiding each other. ]

<the things we brought>
(verse 1)
Ch:
This teacup holds what I could not hide
It's like the wrinkled part of me through time that never seem to dry

I hate the cold raging on outside
So I would turn the heater on to keep my radius alive 

(headphone)
It was the first time that paradise gave out a call
No more lies I arrived I was home

But I look back on myself and there's still nothing
How can I fly if I can't see tomorrow?

[ Brendan and Changan nearly bumped into each other, but they stopped themselves before contact. Music stops abruptly. A short period of silence. ]

(verse 2)
Brendan:
This far I go
I never wander
Try to survive
Dance to the rhythm

Deep down I dive
Into the neurons
But I survived
Connecting every of them

(Take me home, Country Roads Vinyl)
I hear heaven at the end of the road
The mountain she promised me home
The dark and the dust painted on the sky
To the place I belong

(chorus 1)
(Brendan + Changan)
Truth ain't got no reason to fold
When I close my eyes, it pierce like a sword

If I could I'd walk out the door
But I can not go, cause I can't forget

(verse 3)
(Changan singing verse 1 and Brendan singing verse 2 at the same time, overlapping each other)

(chorus)
Brendan + Changan: Truth ain't got no reason to fold
Changan: When I close my eyes
Brendan: It pierce like a sword

Brendan: If I could I'd walk out the door
Changan: But I can not go, cause
Brendan: I can't forget you
---


Act III

[ Stage splits into two living spaces:
- Changan’s new standard unit: Beige wall, living room area is separated from the wall with a wall of frosted glass. The kitchen has an middle-sized oven, but no island.
- Brendan’s upgraded suite. Snow-white wall with grey carpet. There's a study separating living room area and bedroom area. The kitchen has a faux-marble island, and the terrace looks down on the whole colony.
It was nice, but way too quiet, like a ghost town.
3 a.m. and they can't sleep. They lie on their bed, eyes wide open. Brendan was too bored, so he started humming a short melody. Changan did the same. Then they started humming the tune of the background music to this song. ]

<Back to the start>

(verse 1)
Changan (Ch):
I never see the stars
That's shining down on us from above
Maybe you turn it off for fear of
The light be blinding us

Brendan (Br):
Living like I am not
Can't see the light but not yet withered
Drowning me in the night I quiver
Reading between the lines


(chorus 1)(an octane lower)
Brendan: 
I never know where I could start
To place my heart

Changan:
It's like I'm always there in the dark
And you never showed

Brendan:
I thought I know way from the start
Where I belong

Changan:
Nothing would ever do us apart
But now...


(verse 2)
Changan (Ch):
I can not see the stars
That's shining down on us from above
Maybe you turn it off for fear of
The night be blinding us

Brendan (Br):
Living like I am not
Can't see the light but not yet withered
My back is dry but still the shiver

Both:
Taking me from behind

(chorus 2)(an octane higher than chorus 1)
Brendan:
I never know where I can start
To place my heart

Changan:
It's like I'm always there in the dark
But you never know 

Brendan:
I should have known way from the start
Where I belong

Changan:
I wait until life do us apart
Then I...
I go right back to the start

[ Light fade. Chapter ends. ]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ Chapter 10: Split Quarters

Brendan walked into his former former office. Everything's unchanged, but nothing is the same.

His new deputy, already at the front desk, looked up, and nearly flinched. Covered it with a quick smile.
“Sir. Congratulations again.”
Brendan tossed his data tablet on the desk and began shrugging off his jacket without a word.

The deputy tried again. “Nice suite, isn’t it? I heard your quarters came with the promotion. Last one in the Tier-2 block. They had to rotate Officer Wang elsewhere since the cohab unit doesn’t match rank accommodation.”

Brendan froze mid-button. “Excuse me?”
“Wang. Director Wang? Your previous... roommate?”

A pause.
“Standard protocol. Promotion resets your housing class.”

Brendan nodded slowly, then turned away, hiding the smallest breath of relief behind the motion of pouring himself a glass of water. 
That doesn't change anything. He'll probably never get to see Changan again, on this narrow prison called Mars.

His deputy tried to say something flattering, but decided not to and left after Brendan was soaked in his sorrow for too long.

---

He wandered aimlessly into the canteen. "What's the point of eating if I'm not keen on living?" He signed, staring at the ground.
Then he bumped into someone. His jaw dropped, but he reclaimed his calm immediately.
“Director Wang!” Brendan called, grinning. “How nice to meet you! Come sit!”

Changan froze. Their eyes met. And just as fast—Changan broke it and turned, trying to vanish into the crowd.
Brendan’s eyes narrowed, frowned, then they opened wide as he saw the context. 
He grabbed Changan's arm firmly, almost violently, pulled him close, and growled into his ears: "SIT. DOWN."

A surveillance camera caught this. Yellow-flagged.

They sat at the nearest table.
Brendan reached across the table, palm up.
“Fifty credits.”
Changan blinked. “What?”
“Fifty credits. Come on.”
Still dazed, Changan pulled a payment chip from his wallet and tapped it against Brendan’s palm.
Brendan pinched the chip with his index and middle finger, waved it like it's the opening scene of a magic show. "Thank~ you." Then he slipped into his pocket.

After putting a spoonful of mashed potato into his mouth, Brendan started to talk. “How’s your dorm?”
“Clean. Better heating. Queen size bed.”
“Nice, nice. Is it noisy in your new room?"
"It's way too quiet."
"Nice, mine too. Why are you not eating in your office like you used to?”
“I have more time. Air condition system in the office had some problem.”
“That's not good. Call maintenance group. How about...”

At the end, Brendan stood first. “I'll meet you here 12 o'clock tomorrow, okay?”
Changan was evading his eye contact. "Poor little thing." Brendan thought.
Brendan put a hand on Changan's shoulder. "You'll be fine. 12 o'clock tomorrow. Here. Okay?"

---

Changan waited a day. Nothing happened, so he decided to go meet Brendan.
Brendan was scanning the canteen when Changan arrived, then he face-palmed himself. “Damn it,” he muttered. Changan was worried, but he went with Brendan's lead.
Brendan picked the least obvious table, set down his tray, and casually let the edge of his cup slide beneath the tabletop. A soft clink. Then sizzle.
The faintest trail of steam rose from beneath.

Changan was shocked. "Is that... (whisper) a bug?"
"A useless one. What kind of cheap lazy pig would get a bug without IP55 protection?" Brendan rolled his eyes.

“You know why I asked for that fifty dollars?” Brendan says, voice casual.
“Not really.”
“Because what I did—grabbing your arm, whispering—would’ve been yellow-flagged. Maybe red if they were cranky. So I needed a motive: you owed me money.”
Changan raised an eyebrow.
“I know, right.” Brendan continued, voice still casual. “Our new model doing well?”
“I think so.”
“Of course it is. You’ve been taking full-hour lunches.”
Changan winces. “I still think we’re being watched.”
“Of course we are,” Brendan says. “But think about this: those surveillance centers probably use a different flagging system. Our model won’t work well on surveillance camera footages. But if their system is as busted as ours used to be…”

He grins.

“They’ll come asking for a new model. And I’ve got a plan.”
Changan doesn’t reply. But he doesn’t argue.

---

“They reached out,” Chengan said before even sitting. “Bureau of Safety and Stability. They want us to showcase the model.”
“Nice, only took them 3 months.” Brendan smirked. "Not bad for colony standard."
Changan narrowed his eyes. “What are you planning?”

Brendan leaned in, eyes bright.
“Lets say there's a few behavioral exceptions in the flagging system. The frequency is so low they won't even notice.”
"What are you talking about?"
"They'll probably expect intimacy in public to be red-flagged, but hugging, holding hands or even kissing never hurt anyone. Why shouldn't we?"
Changan frowned. "You're going to get caught."
Brendan shrugged. "First of all, we'll be prudent. We'll Trojan Horse the patch into the system and release it when no one is watching anymore. Second, with Youssef's plate full, I'll probably be the one they turn to to examine the source code. Those cheap, lazy pigs won't even know that this is an inside job."
"And most importantly, so what if they find out? We'll just apologize, blame it on the training data, get a slap on the wrist. Maybe we get to share a room again if we're lucky."

Changan felt his stomach rolling. This feels eerily familiar.
Brendan grabbed both his arms. "Trust me. When an opportunity comes, we have to grab it. You want a better Mars, don't you?"
"I... I guess?"
Brendan gave Changan the sweetest smile, the kind he know Changan could never resist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ Chapter 11: Degeneration

Changa drank 3 bottles of water during the 5-minute presentation showcasing the new flagging model developed by the Media and Emotional Stability Department. Officer Abdul seemed concerned about his well-being.

However, he did complete the presentation concisely.

Officer Abdul was waiting for the board members to come to a conclusion again. "The board sincerely requests that the Media and Emotional Stability Department develop an updated model capable of parsing real-time surveillance footage for deviant conduct."
He paused. "Could such request be fulfilled within 2 months?"

Changan was chugging in his fifth bottle of water at that moment. He finished the bottle, wiped his mouth. "We would do our best. If more time is needed, we would submit a request 2 weeks before the deadline."

"Very well. Meeting adjourned."

---

Jimmy waited outside the restroom for Changan.
5 minutes later, Changan finally finished.

"They didn't even say what it's for." Jimmy whispered beside him.
"Well, anything for the good of the colony, right?" Changan said. "Let's go."

---

Brendan stopped eating lunch with Changan.

Instead, Changan found a USB drive under table #13, stuck to the under surface of the lunch table with a blu tack. It held compressed dev logs, snippets of code, and one-word filenames like BLUEPRINT, NEEDLE, and GHOST.
Changan left his replies in the same spot: architecture notes, alternate loss functions, innocuous changelogs buried in folder trees.

On the outside, they barely acknowledged each other.
Inside, the patch took shape.

---

The modified model was completed in time. It was leaner, faster, optimized for CCTV input.

The board suggested that Brendan Hertz, Chief officer of Power Allocation Department examine the model.
Brendan waited a week, then returned it with minor syntax edits, suggested metadata tags, and one flagged misclassification: a passerby helping a fallen senior citizen up, misread as a physical altercation.

After corrections, the patch was launched.

---

Brendan set the secondary patch to release in 14 days.

Changan opened the terminal to Brendan's message in the USB drive: 
"Project Blindspot: trial
- Timing: 2125/05/05, 12:30 (22th day after its launch)
- Place: Section H, beside the old oxygen exchange pipe
- Action: incremental, with deniability
-- Trial #1: Ch drop wallet, Br pick it up, grab Ch's shoulder to notice him. (5-10 sec)
-- Trial #2: Ch hide a gift behind the corner, blindfold Brendan, hold his hands and lead him to the present. (20-30 sec)
-- Trial #3: Br act like he is not physically fit, and pretend to faint. Ch hold him in his arms. Br recover gradually. (2-3 min)
- Verification: Wait three days after each trial. No alerts = proceed. Delayed alert = abort.
"
Changan stared at the screen, mesmerized.
Still couldn’t believe a man so vibrant yet so precise fell for him. It felt like a dream on the verge of becoming a nightmare.

He couldn’t stop wavering.
---

They waited a full week before Trial #3, because Changan needed to be sure.
They met at the designated spot. Nodded. Began.

Brendan walked unevenly, looking at his phone. Changan waved, unacknowledged. Then Brendan collapsed. Changan caught him just in time.
He checked for breath and pulse. He let Brendan stay in his arms for another two minutes.
Finally, he whispered, "You can wake up now."
Brendan stirred, then buried his face in Changan’s stomach. Changan blushed.

Brendan stood. Changan looped his arm over his shoulder, supporting him as they walked.

Then, around the corner—

Brendan pressed Changan against the wall, caging him with both arms.
"Impeccable performance, Director Wang," he said, eyes gleaming like a predator tasting blood.
"W.. we should wait until Trial #3 is verified..." Changan stammered.
"No need. The writing’s on the wall," Brendan replied, pressing closer.

Changan ducked, slipping free. "We wait. Okay?"
Brendan hesitated. Then nodded.

They returned to work.

---

During the monthly board update, Chief Secretary of the Safety and Stability Office mentioned that the new model had stabilized at 88% efficiency.
The board members applauded this achievement, except one.

"I move to raise a concern."
"Granted." Said Abdul.
"Officer Brendan Hertz was a principal contributor to the previous model. His assessment may carry unconscious bias."
Silence.
"The current model is effective," someone countered. "Reexamination will cause disruption."
"It would be a limited audit within five workdays. We’ll revert to the old model in the interim."
He glanced at the rest of the board members. "For the long term good of the colony."

Abdul looked around. "All in favor?"
Unanimous.
"Motion approved."

---

An exhausted flagging officer rubbed his eyes. Since the rollback, his workload had doubled. Maybe Tripled.
"I HATE big government." He muttered.

Another red flag alert. He growled, expecting to see someone standing too close to another person for too long.
"I'll be out of here in a week. Next time I rotate to this post would be 2 years later." He comforted himself. 

Instead, his eyes widened.
There were two man kissing. A man's hand was wrapped around the other man's neck, and the other man is rubbing that man's crutch.
Face recognition system said: Brendan Hertz, Chief Director of Power Allocation Department; Changan Wang, Chief Director of Media and Emotional Stability Department.

He closed the window, drank a whole bottle of coffee, then stared at the screen for a while.
He backed up the surveillance footage, saved it to a USB drive, deleted the log, and rushed to his superior's office with the USB driver.

---

Brendan and Changan sat opposite to each other in a discrete detention cell. The silence dripped onto them like wet concrete, crushing their every bone slowly.

Changan closed his eyes.

Brendan looked down. 
"Maybe next time, we don't try it... on ourselves."


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ Chapter 12: Slap on the Wrist

The Chief Director of the colony was frowning so hard his head hurt.

Hertz again.

Earth was already sniffing around for inefficiencies and compliance slips. A same-sex intimacy scandal between two high-ranking officers? The kind of attention no one could afford.

He flagged the file and forwarded it to his trash bin. I mean deputy director.

---

Youssef was in the middle of reviewing a request for power grid renewal when the file landed on his terminal. He took a quick peek.
"Oh, hell no!"
He opened it with the rage of a thousand sun.

Brendan Hertz and Changan Wang. Same-sex intimacy caught on surveillance camera, red flagged.
He could rip the cock right off Brendan Hertz, but he just smashed the framed photo of him and Brendan against the wall instead. 


Youssef collapsed onto his chair, rubbing his temples.
He still had at least 12 hours worth of work in queue, and 95% of Mars personnel were single men. It would be impossible to stop this kind of case from flooding in. 
Moreover, Earth politics were a landmine field: if he went soft, he’d be branded negligent.
If he punished them harshly, he could be cancelled for being a homophobe. Youssef felt chills down his spine.
Worst of all, Brendan was good to him. He knew he should be impartial, but he just couldn't. Also, he didn't want to be seen as ungrateful.

Another uphill battle.

He dug up the original clause: "No intimacy between same-sex personnel."
"It was actually an executive order from Director Claudius? Isn't that guy a known homophobe and tyrant?"

Youssef felt unease, paged through flagged cases. He was baffled by the statistics:
72% of reported officers had been model employees at least once; up to 42% of reported officers were falsely-claimed, or are retaliated.
Youssef knew there would be corruption, but not like this.
34% of reported officers were convicted and reassigned to remote posts. Half of those reassignments caused endless rank changes, which lead to endless chaos.

Youssef knew the system could not be trusted, but this is on a whole new level.

He submitted a request to Earth:
“I, Deputy Director of Mars Colony, Youssef Ahsan, suggest a revision on Mars Executive Order clause 211: 'No intimacy between same-sex personnel.'

The rationale is as follow:
First, this clause disproportionately targets visible, competent personnel, often for retaliatory purposes. Its enforcement causes great disruption in the chain of command, destabilizing the system.
Second, the clause originates from an infamous chief director of the Mars colony, whose doing such as excessive enforcement and homophobia is best left forgotten. 

I suggest that the clause be revised as: ‘No public displays of intimacy between same-sex personnel.’”

---

Three days later, Earth responded.
"Amended language approved. Retroactive application permitted for special-case scenarios."
Youssef filed it, and forwarded the closure form.

He picked up the frame on the other side of the room, took out the photo, rubbed it into a ball, and threw it in the trash.

---

Brendan and Changan were released without even a punishment.
Their personal items were returned to them in a boutique box. Changan suspect the surface of his phone has been particularly cleaned.
The guards were extra polite to them on their way out. Changan was uneasy, while Brendan's steps turned into strides.

Brendan reached out for Changan's hand.
Changan stepped away.

---

That night, Changan was at home editing propaganda footage he left off 3 days ago.

The door opened.

Brendan strolled in, whistling, chipper.
"Guess who’s free~"

Changan didn’t look up.
"I’m working."

Unfazed, Brendan padded into the kitchen, pulled down the burlap bag, poured the leaves into the pot.
He let it steep, then carried it to the living room table and poured two cups. 

Changan finally finished his work. He dragged his feet into the living room area.
"Come on. Sit." Brendan patted the couch beside him.
Changan sighed and sat down.

Brendan beamed. "Hey, be happy."
Changan murmured, "Like I have a choice."
"What?"
"Nothing."

Brendan was relentless. 
"I can't believe we never opened it the whole time we were together." He laughed. "But we won! I guess there's no better time to open it."
He poured a cup and shoved it into Changan's face. "Come on! Have a taste!" 

Changan set the cup down. “I’m fine.”
Brendan was slightly disappointed, but he kept trying. "Well, I know a way to cheer you up~"
He reached his hand between Changan's legs.


Changan slapped it away.
"Stop it! Whatever you’re doing! Just stop!"

Brendan blinked. "Babe, what’s wrong?"
"YOU are what's wrong! You think you know everything! I don't want any of this, you keep pushing and I didn't know how to resist!"
Brendan was angry. "How can you say this? I worked so hard. I did it all for us!"
"No!" Changan yelled. "You did it all for YOU! I am just an escort so you don't feel bored on your adventure!"
He breathed in before he shouted out: "You are a hopeless, selfish jerk!"

Brendan’s face twisted. Hurt turned fast to fury.
"Whatever, Chan-gan!"
Then he walked out, slamming the door behind him.


Changan sat quiet on the couch, watched as the cup of tea turned cold.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@ Chapter 13: The Post You Should Have Ignored

When developing the new flagging model, the Media and Emotional Wellbeing Department decided on saving the wildest conspiracy posts for "manual inspection": it had been their only entertainment outlet during office hours.

Changan got a "Conspiracy Theory Post Alert" in the late afternoon. He was excited.

"Come on, come on, come on, get daddy the good stuff~" he muttered as he opened the post.

“The government is experimenting on patients with rare cancer at Cronenberg Memorial Hospital with novel therapies that can cause severe side effects? Bo~ring~ Am I supposed to believe these AI slop monstrosities are real cancer patients? Kids these days lack originality.” He spun lazily in his office chair, mocking the text.

Still, he read through the whole post before censoring it. Synovial sarcoma? Clear-cell carcinoma? Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors? He probably asked a chatbot for the 10 rarest cancers or something.

He flagged it, deleted it, and went home.
Had a good night's sleep.

---

The next morning before work, Changan received a message:

"Dear Media and Emotional Wellbeing Officers, the department office underwent a gas leak last night; luckily no one was harmed. However, the office, including the database center, will be shut down for at least three weeks for repairs; data access will be restricted. Please enjoy your paid time off and patiently wait for further notice."

Joy surged over him. He walked through his morning routine at half his normal speed.

But the censored post and this morning's notice stuck in his throat like a hairball. He scribbled down what he remembered about the post: "Conanberg Memorial Hospital", "Synthetic Coma", "Clear Cell Cancer", "Malignant..." whatever. The name's too long.
He convinced himself to let the feeling go and returned to his fluffy paid day-off.

9:20 a.m. Nothing to do. Nothing to think about.
He strolled into the living room area and saw the the pot of tea still sitting on the table.
Were they ever good for each other? Or was that what Brendan tried to make him think?
Changan was still messy inside, so he decided to give himself more time to think.

---

A few days later during lunch, Changan bumped into Sam and Jimmy in the food court.

"Hey guys, how have you been?" asked Changan.
"It's awesome! I can sleep in every day and play 'When Empires Rise' as long as I want!"
Changan frowned. Wasn't that game pure neo-libertarian propaganda? Also, it was made hastily in 40 days to fill a quota, 30 years ago, by the old Media and Wellbeing Department.
Guess Brendan was right. These boys are dumb.

"Oh, have you heard? Mr. Hertz was sick. We're going to visit him in the hospital this afternoon, are you coming, Mr. Wang?"
Changan wasn't ready for this at all; he could only wave his hands haphazardly and mutter, "Oh well I have something to do or something like that. You should just go without me, hehehe..."
Sam and Jimmy looked at each other, confused. But eventually, they just stood up and said goodbye to Changan before they left.
"What was that?" Jimmy asked. "I think they had a fight," Sam speculated.

Changan heard everything they whispered. He rolled his eyes.

---

3 weeks into his paid vacation, Changan kept bumping into snacks he thought Brendan would have liked in the canteen. He finally decided to share his exploration with Brendan. As a friend.

"I found some snacks you might like, should we meet during lunch tomorrow?" He wrote the message in the most casual way possible, after rewriting his draft a thousand times.
"I'm still in the hospital."

---

Changan didn't want to bother the nurses rushing in and out of wards, so he took his time looking for Brendan's room.

He knocked, opened the door, but immediately apologized and tried to close it.
“Chan-gan.”
His body froze, one hand still on the doorknob. Eyes trembling.
Then he stepped inside, shutting the door behind him with a quiet click.
His tears came fast, silently. He turned his face away from the hall.
Brendan sat on his bed, waiting for Changan to cry himself dry. Then he smiled, opening his arms for Changan.


"I've thought about it. It would be pretty cool to be a cancer survivor." Brendan said as he crunched on Changan's snack. "They said I have 'clear-cell carcinoma' in my kidney. Such an beautiful name, sounds like crystal."
Changan still couldn't say anything, just tightly holding his cold, papery hand. He couldn't see any Brendan left in this skeleton sitting in front of him.
"I'll be going to Cronenberg Memorial Medical Center tomorrow. Hope the food's better there." He put another chip into his mouth. 
"I used to think all I needed was a perfect algorithm. But when the boys brought me snacks... and talked to me... " Brendan's voice cracked. "They made me so happy."
Changan’s sobs returned, his whole body trembling. Brendan wrapped an arm around him and rubbed slow, quiet circles on his back.
"You are a patient and tender person. You deserve someone who sees you and makes you happy."
Changan shook his head with tears in his eyes. 
"I'm here for you." Brendan said, with tears rolling down his face. "As long as I can."

---

Changan stood by the window, replaying what Brendan said over and over again in his head. He couldn't tell which Brendan was the real one: the scheming yet charismatic devil, or the vulnerably genuine skeleton he met this afternoon.
Whichever it was, Brendan was not here to figure it out with him.

All of a sudden, something hit him. He grabbed his scribble of that post that shut down the whole department: "Conanberg Memorial". "Clear Cell Cancer".

Brendan was in danger.

---

The next morning, he reached Youssef's office and scheduled a meeting immediately. Youssef picked up shortly after the AI assistant and scheduled their meeting right before office hours were over.

Changan entered the room. "There's this mutual friend of ours."

Youssef cursed, pressed a button. "Room is clear. Go on."

"3 weeks age, I received a post reporting the human experiments at Cronenberg Memorial Hospital, and the post mentioned a list of rare cancers. The next day, the Media and Emotional Wellbeing Department was shut down and denied database access till this day." Changan explained. "Brendan was diagnosed with one of the cancers on that list, and he was sent to Cronenberg Memorial Hospital this morning."

Youssef was furious. "Those bastards!" He immediately called the director of Cronenberg Memorial Hospital with the intercommunication system. "Director of Power Allocation Office, Brendan Hertz, his previous project requires his oversight. Please return him with full function at once."

Six weeks and several resection surgeries later, he was cured and discharged.
