                                        <p>By morning, Changan's ears were in agony.<br>
                                        The screen strain gave him blurring migraines. The earphones pressed too deep, slicing at already-sensitive cartilage.<br>
                                        By 7 a.m., his right ear canal was bleeding.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Still, no sound leaked from his room.</p>

                                        <hr class="paragraph-separator">

                                        <p>Office hours were over.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Changan stared at the box for a long time before even touching it. A box left right in front of your apartmentdoor without being confiscated by the building security guard could mean a lot, but not much.<br>
                                        He finally accepted his fate, since it's only a matter of time.<br>
                                        It was a well-made headphone. Noise-canceling. Proper padding.<br>
                                        No one ever gave him anything without a reason.<br>
                                        He didn't care. He put them on immediately. No scraping, no ache. Only the dull hum of filtered sound. He nearly cried again.</p>
                                        
                                        <hr class="paragraph-separator">
                                        
                                        <p>That night, just before 01:00, heavy boots thundered down the corridor.<br>
                                        Metal rang. Commands barked. A voice he recognized—Brendan's—raised, then abruptly cut off.<br>
                                        Changan didn't move. He didn't look through the peephole. He didn't even flinch.<br>
                                        Instead, he turned up the volume: it covered the shouting. The dragging. The silence that followed.<br>
                                        He kept working long past the point of clarity, until his vision blurred and the cursor blinked without input. He didn't remember falling asleep—only waking up hours later with a stiff neck.<br>
                                        The headphones were still on.</p>
                                        
                                        <hr class="paragraph-separator">
                                        
                                        <p>The next day, lunch was replaced with a summons.<br>
                                        He was escorted to a windowless conference room. Harsh light. A long table.<br>
                                        Brendan sat on the other side. He looked like he hadn't slept at all.<br>
                                        An officer read out the charges—unauthorized equipment transmission, signal misattribution, breach of device origin protocol. The wiretap had flagged revolutionary content. From Brendan's headphone. While he was asleep.<br>
                                        Until it kept playing after he was arrested.<br>
                                        Changan sat silent.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Brendan eventually confessed. He gave him the headphones. An act of kindness.<br>
                                        "We don't punish kindness," the officer said, smiling with no warmth, "only negligence."<br>
                                        They were dismissed with minor penalties: written censure. Docked rations. Weeks of increased monitoring.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Nothing serious.<br>
                                        Nothing forgettable.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>They walked out together. Said nothing. Didn't look at each other.<br>
                                        It was a long walk back to their neighboring cells. I mean room.</p>
