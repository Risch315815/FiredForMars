                            <p>The hallway was quiet in the way only Mars could be—pressurized stillness, the faint hiss of climate regulators, the muffled rotation of surveillance cameras. Apartment 3E‑7 flickered dimly with occupancy lights. Its neighbor—3E‑8—vibrated, just barely, with the sound of another late-night review log, playing through unfiltered speakers.</p>
                            
                            <p>Brendan stood outside the door, shoulders square, holding a burlap bag wrapped with red velvet tape.</p>
                            
                            <p>He'd rehearsed three versions of this conversation. He didn't like any of them. But the buffering lights in his own unit pulsed to the rhythm of someone else's content audits—and he'd already let it go too long.</p>
                            
                            <p>He exhaled and knocked, twice—brisk, professional.</p>
                            
                            <p>It took thirty seconds for the door to open.</p>
                            
                            <p>Changan appeared: shirt half-buttoned, collar wilted, the corner of his mouth twitching. His eyes found the gift first. Then Brendan's face.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Officer Hertz," Changan said. Smooth. Edged. The voice of a man who knew every word could be archived.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Director Wang," Brendan replied, leaning in, a social smile fixed to his face. "Thank you so much for agreeing to meet me at such a late hour."</p>
                            
                            <p class="note">(He had messaged first, of course. Courtesy.)</p>
                            
                            <p>Without a pause, Brendan took Changan's hand and pressed the package into it.</p>
                            
                            <p>"A pleasant supplement," he said, each word chiseled, "for a good night's sleep."</p>
                            
                            <p>Changan's body moved before he thought.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Where are my manners. Please, come in. I'm terribly sorry for the mess."</p>
                            
                            <p>He placed the gift at the center of the living room table, fingers barely brushing the velvet.</p>
                            
                            <p>"It is such noble work you're doing," Brendan said, still smiling. "But please—do be careful. You never know who's on the other side of the wall. It would be a shame if anything fell into the wrong ears."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Officer Hertz," Changan replied gently, "there's no one on the other side of the wall."</p>
                            
                            <p>Brendan blinked. The shamelessness. The evasion.</p>
                            
                            <p>"I suppose I just don't have the mental capacity to process everything I hear," he said, with mock reflection. "Who knows what I might do."</p>
                            
                            <p>Changan's eyes widened, but he reined himself in.</p>
                            
                            <p>"I'm really sorry, sir. It's just… I've been wearing headphones for twelve hours today. And you know the quality of the cushion. Please—"</p>
                            
                            <p>"Oh! How diligent of you!" Brendan beamed. "Perhaps I can take a look at your AI auditor. Help make it more efficient?"</p>
                            
                            <p>Changan's mouth twitched. He straightened.</p>
                            
                            <p>"I believe everyone has the right to approach his life the way he fancies," Brendan continued. "I just hope he knows others have important work to do. Work that requires ample rest. Isn't that right, Chan-gan?"</p>
                            
                            <p>The name landed like a slap.</p>
                            
                            <p>Changan's smile froze on his face. His hands shook.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Please leave," he said, smiling.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Excuse me?"</p>
                            
                            <p>"I said—please leave."</p>
                            
                            <p>The smile vanished.</p>
                            
                            <p>Brendan stepped out, silent. No eye contact. No apology.</p>
                            
                            <p>The door hissed shut.<br>
                            Changan dropped into his chair, staring at the velvet-wrapped package still sitting on the table like a forgotten message.</p>
                            
                            <p>The shame wasn't in being loud. It was in being an inconvenience. In being noticed.</p>
                            
                            <p>He was breathing rapidly now. He had to disappear again, before someone noticed what he really was.</p>
                            
                            <p>With trembling hands, he opened the burlap bag—not out of curiosity, but as a distraction; hoping it would be trash, so he could throw away the last ten minutes and pretend they'd never happened.</p>
                            
                            <p>Inside was a vacuum-sealed packet of Earth-grown tea. His favorite thing when he was growing up in a small mountain town in Fujian.</p>
                            
                            <p>He cried uncontrollably. It was the first time in twenty years.</p>
