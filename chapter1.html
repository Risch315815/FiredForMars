                                        <p>Outside apartment 3E‑7, there were nothing but the screech of surveillance camera rotating.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Brendan stood outside the door, shoulders square, holding a burlap bag wrapped with red velvet tape.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>He'd rehearsed three versions of this conversation. He didn't like any of them, but he can't stand another night of the noise next door flooding through his paper-thin wall, crushing his serenity. "How can a chief of an entire department be so... so clueless? I know he's a humanitarian degree major, but this is still absurd!" 
                                        However, he's still the director of a department, and it's never good to leak your superiority, so better safe than sorry.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>He exhaled and knocked, twice—brisk, professional.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>It took thirty seconds for the door to open.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Changan appeared: shirt half-buttoned, collar wilted, the corner of his mouth twitching. His eyes found the gift first. Then Brendan's face.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Brendan frowned at the sight of his shabbiness.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"Officer Hertz," Changan said.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"Director Wang," Brendan replied, leaning in, a social smile fixed to his face. "Thank you so much for agreeing to meet me at such a late hour."</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Without a pause, Brendan took Changan's hand and pressed the package into it.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"A pleasant supplement," he said, each word chiseled, "for a good night's sleep."</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Changan's body moved before he thought.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"Where are my manners. Please, come in. I'm terribly sorry for the mess."</p>
                                        
                                        <p>He placed the gift at the center of the living room table, fingers barely brushing the velvet.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"It is such noble work you're doing," Brendan said, still smiling. "But please—do be careful. You never know who's on the other side of the wall. It would be a shame if anything fell into the wrong ears."</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"Officer Hertz," Changan replied gently, "there's no one on the other side of the wall."</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Brendan blinked. The shamelessness.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"I suppose I just don't have the mental capacity to process everything I hear," Brendan said, with a forced smile. "Who knows what I might do."</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Changan's eyes widened, but he reined himself in.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"I'm really sorry, sir. It's just… I've been wearing headphones for twelve hours today. And you know the quality of the cushion. Please—"</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"Oh! How diligent of you!" Brendan beamed. "Perhaps I can take a look at your AI auditor. Help make it more efficient?"</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Changan's mouth twitched. He straightened.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"I believe everyone has the right to approach his life the way he fancies," Brendan continued. "I just hope he knows others have important work to do. Work that requires ample rest. Isn't that right, Chan-gan?"</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The name landed like a slap.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Changan's smile froze on his face. His hands shook.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"Please leave," he said, smiling.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"Excuse me?"</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"I said—please leave." The smile vanished.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Brendan stepped out, silent. No eye contact. No apology.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The door hissed shut.</p>

                                        <hr class="paragraph-separator">
                                        
                                        <p>Changan dropped into his chair, staring at the velvet-wrapped package still sitting on the table like a forgotten message.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The shame wasn't in being loud. It was in being an inconvenience. In being noticed.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>He was breathing rapidly now. He had to disappear again, before someone noticed what he really was.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>With trembling hands, he opened the burlap bag—not out of curiosity, but as a distraction; hoping it would be trash, so he could throw away the last ten minutes and pretend they'd never happened.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Inside was a vacuum-sealed packet of Earth-grown tea. His favorite thing when he was growing up in a small mountain village in Fujian.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>He cried uncontrollably. It was the first time in twenty years.</p>
